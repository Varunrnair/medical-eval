"1. If I had painful periods in the past does it affect my child?
","If you had painful periods in the past, it may or may not affect your pregnancy or child. Painful periods can be caused by conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, infections, or adenomyosis, which may increase the risk of pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth, or low birth weight in some women. Itâ€™s important to share your menstrual history with your doctor so they can check for these conditions and provide the right care. Most women with painful periods still have healthy pregnancies, but regular checkups are important.","Painful periods, also known as dysmenorrhea, typically don't directly affect your child's health once you're pregnant. However, it's important to discuss your medical history, including any past issues with painful periods, during your prenatal care visits.
