reproductive and sexual health,"1. If I had painful periods in the past does it affect my child?
","If you had painful periods in the past, it may or may not affect your pregnancy or child. Painful periods can be caused by conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, infections, or adenomyosis, which may increase the risk of pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth, or low birth weight in some women. It’s important to share your menstrual history with your doctor so they can check for these conditions and provide the right care. Most women with painful periods still have healthy pregnancies, but regular checkups are important.","यदि आपको पहले भी दर्दनाक मासिक धर्म हुआ है, तो यह आपकी गर्भावस्था या बच्चे को प्रभावित कर सकता है या नहीं भी कर सकता है। दर्दनाक मासिक धर्म एंडोमेट्रियोसिस, फाइब्रॉएड, संक्रमण या एडेनोमायसिस जैसी स्थितियों के कारण हो सकता है, जो कुछ महिलाओं में गर्भपात, समय से पहले जन्म या कम वजन वाले बच्चे जैसी गर्भावस्था जटिलताओं के जोखिम को बढ़ा सकता है। अपने मासिक धर्म के इतिहास को अपने डॉक्टर के साथ साझा करना महत्वपूर्ण है ताकि वे इन स्थितियों की जांच कर सकें और सही देखभाल प्रदान कर सकें। दर्दनाक मासिक धर्म वाली अधिकांश महिलाओं की गर्भावस्था अभी भी स्वस्थ है, लेकिन नियमित जांच महत्वपूर्ण है।","जर तुम्हाला पूर्वी वेदनादायक मासिक पाळी आली असेल, तर त्याचा तुमच्या गर्भधारणेवर किंवा बाळावर परिणाम होऊ शकतो किंवा होऊ शकत नाही. वेदनादायक मासिक पाळीमुळे गर्भाशयाचे अस्तर सारखी ऊती वाढणे, गर्भाशयतील गाठ तयार होणे , संसर्ग किंवा गर्भाशयाच्या स्नायूंच्या भिंतीमध्ये गर्भाशयाच्या अस्तर ऊतीचे वाढणे . इ प्रारच्या समस्या वेदनदायी मासिक पळीमुळे होऊ शकते, ज्यामुळे काही महिलांमध्ये गर्भपात, मुदतपूर्व जन्म किंवा कमी वजन यासारख्या गर्भधारणेच्या गुंतागुंतीचा धोका वाढू शकतो. तुमच्या मासिक पाळीचा इतिहास तुमच्या डॉक्टरांशी संभाषण करणे महत्वाचे आहे जेणेकरून ते या परिस्थिती हाताळू शकतात  आणि योग्य काळजी घेण्याचा सल्ला देऊ शकतील. वेदनादायक मासिक पाळी असलेल्या बहुतेक महिलांना अजूनही निरोगी गर्भधारणा होते, परंतु नियमित तपासणी करणे महत्वाचे आहे.",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351718/      https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9187594/  https://flo.health/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/complications/adenomyosis-and-pregnancy  ,"Having painful periods in the past generally does not affect your child during pregnancy or their health after birth.

clinical procedures and interventions,"1. How to prepare for the delivery at healthcare center?
","To prepare for delivery at a healthcare center, start by talking to your doctor ahead of time about where you will deliver and your delivery plan. Keep a hospital bag ready by your eighth or ninth month, packed with comfortable clothes, personal items, and any medicines you take. Learn about the signs of labor, such as regular contractions, water breaking, or bleeding, so you know when to leave for the hospital. Plan your transport in advance, including backup options, since getting to the hospital quickly can be difficult in rural areas. Discuss your plan with your family and local health worker so everyone knows what to do when labor starts.
