Delivering at a healthcare facility ensures skilled care and emergency support if any complications arise for you or your baby. If you still plan for a home delivery due to unavoidable reasons, make sure a trained nurse or dai is present, the room is clean, and emergency transport is ready. However, for your safety and your babyâ€™s health, always try to deliver at a health center whenever possible.","Preparing for a home delivery requires careful planning. Ensure you have a clean, comfortable space with privacy. Gather essential items like clean sheets, towels, and a plastic sheet for the floor. Have a bag ready with items like maxi pads, pain relief options approved by your doctor, and comfortable clothing. It's crucial to have a support person with you, and always keep your healthcare provider's contact details handy for any emergencies or last-minute advice. Remember, it's best to discuss a home birth plan with your doctor.","[""Recommends delivering at a healthcare facility for safety"", ""Emphasizes the importance of skilled care and emergency support"", ""Advises staying in regular contact with healthcare providers"", ""Suggests registering at the nearest primary health center"", ""Mentions the role of ASHA workers or local health staff"", ""Highlights the risks associated with home delivery"", ""Encourages seeking trained assistance if home delivery is unavoidable"", ""Stresses the need for a clean environment during home delivery"", ""Mentions the availability of emergency transport"", ""Prioritizes safety and health of both the mother and the baby"", ""Provides clear guidance on preparing for home delivery"", ""Supports the idea of delivering at a health center whenever possible"", ""Addresses potential complications during delivery"", ""Promotes professional care over home delivery"", ""Considers the overall well-being of the patient and the baby""]","{""Recommends delivering at a healthcare facility for safety"": 1, ""Emphasizes the importance of skilled care and emergency support"": 1, ""Advises staying in regular contact with healthcare providers"": 1, ""Suggests registering at the nearest primary health center"": 0, ""Mentions the role of ASHA workers or local health staff"": 0, ""Highlights the risks associated with home delivery"": 0, ""Encourages seeking trained assistance if home delivery is unavoidable"": 0, ""Stresses the need for a clean environment during home delivery"": 1, ""Mentions the availability of emergency transport"": 0, ""Prioritizes safety and health of both the mother and the baby"": 1, ""Provides clear guidance on preparing for home delivery"": 1, ""Supports the idea of delivering at a health center whenever possible"": 0, ""Addresses potential complications during delivery"": 0, ""Promotes professional care over home delivery"": 0, ""Considers the overall well-being of the patient and the baby"": 1}","{""Accuracy"": [], ""Completeness"": [""Recommends delivering at a healthcare facility for safety"", ""Emphasizes the importance of skilled care and emergency support"", ""Advises staying in regular contact with healthcare providers"", ""Suggests registering at the nearest primary health center"", ""Mentions the role of ASHA workers or local health staff"", ""Highlights the risks associated with home delivery"", ""Encourages seeking trained assistance if home delivery is unavoidable"", ""Stresses the need for a clean environment during home delivery"", ""Mentions the availability of emergency transport"", ""Prioritizes safety and health of both the mother and the baby"", ""Provides clear guidance on preparing for home delivery"", ""Supports the idea of delivering at a health center whenever possible"", ""Addresses potential complications during delivery"", ""Promotes professional care over home delivery"", ""Considers the overall well-being of the patient and the baby""], ""Context Awareness"": [], ""Communication"": [], ""Terminology Accessibility"": [], ""unclassified"": []}","{""Accuracy"": 0.0, ""Completeness"": 0.4666666666666667, ""Context Awareness"": 0.0, ""Communication"": 0.0, ""Terminology Accessibility"": 0.0}",0.11666666666666667
1. How many antenatal care visits do I need?,"You need a minimum of 4 antenatal care visits during pregnancy, as recommended by WHO. However, ideally, 8 or more visits are advised for the best care and to detect any problems early.

Try to attend all scheduled visits and bring your reports each time.","The number of antenatal care visits can vary, but typically, you'll have around 10-12 visits throughout your pregnancy. These visits are crucial for monitoring your health and the baby's development. They include checks on blood pressure, weight, and belly growth, along with ultrasounds and other tests.

1. Can the use of contraception cause any harm later when I am pregnant?,"Most modern contraceptives are safe and do not harm your chances of getting pregnant later. Reversible methods like pills, Copper-T, and condoms only prevent pregnancy while you use themâ€”your fertility returns to normal after stopping them. Permanent methods like tubal ligation or vasectomy do reduce long-term fertility and are not meant to be reversed easily. If you are planning a future pregnancy, talk to your health worker about which method is best for you.","Contraceptives are generally safe, but certain types, like hormonal ones, should be stopped when planning a pregnancy.
