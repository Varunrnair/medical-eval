1. Can the use of contraception cause any harm later when I am pregnant?,"Most modern contraceptives are safe and do not harm your chances of getting pregnant later.

If you are planning a future pregnancy, talk to your health worker about which method is best for you.","Contraceptives are generally safe, but certain types may have effects on future pregnancies. For example, some hormonal contraceptives might take a few months to regulate your cycle after stopping. IUDs (intrauterine devices) should be removed before pregnancy.
