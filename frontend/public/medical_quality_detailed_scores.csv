1. How to prepare for delivery at home?,"Home delivery is not advisable for any woman, even in rural or low-resource settings. It is safest to register at the nearest primary health center and stay in regular contact with your ASHA worker or local health staff.

1. Can the use of contraception cause any harm later when I am pregnant?,"Most modern contraceptives are safe and do not harm your chances of getting pregnant later. Reversible methods like pills, Copper-T, and condoms only prevent pregnancy while you use them—your fertility returns to normal after stopping them.

If you are planning a future pregnancy, talk to your health worker about which method is best for you.","Contraceptives are generally safe, but certain types may have effects on future pregnancies. For example, some hormonal contraceptives might take a few months to regulate your cycle after stopping. IUDs (intrauterine devices) should be removed before pregnancy.
