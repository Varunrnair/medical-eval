1. How to prepare for delivery at home?,"Home delivery is not advisable for any woman, even in rural or low-resource settings. It is safest to register at the nearest primary health center and stay in regular contact with your ASHA worker or local health staff. Delivering at a healthcare facility ensures skilled care and emergency support if any complications arise for you or your baby.

Ensure you have a clean, comfortable space with privacy. Gather essential items like clean sheets, towels, and a plastic sheet for the floor.

1. Can the use of contraception cause any harm later when I am pregnant?,"Most modern contraceptives are safe and do not harm your chances of getting pregnant later.

Permanent methods like tubal ligation or vasectomy do reduce long-term fertility and are not meant to be reversed easily.
