1. How to prepare for delivery at home?,"Home delivery is not advisable for any woman, even in rural or low-resource settings. It is safest to register at the nearest primary health center and stay in regular contact with your ASHA worker or local health staff. Delivering at a healthcare facility ensures skilled care and emergency support if any complications arise for you or your baby.
