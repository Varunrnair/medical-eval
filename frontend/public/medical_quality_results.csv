1. Do my irregular periods affect my pregnancy and child?,"Irregular periods usually do not affect pregnancy or your child unless there is an underlying medical problem. If the cause is something like PCOS, thyroid disease, or other hormonal or structural issues, there may be a higher risk of complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm birth, or low birth weight.

However, irregular cycles might indicate underlying hormonal imbalances or other health issues that could impact fertility. It's a good idea to consult your doctor to ensure any potential issues are addressed. They can provide personalized advice and support throughout your pregnancy journey.","['Does the response mention that irregular periods usually do not affect pregnancy or the child unless there is an
