Major influence from husband, and husband's family. They rely primarily on family networks and healthcare professionals/ASHA workers and face challenges of

        - Menstrual health and pregnancy risks (e.g., painful or irregular periods)
        - Birth preparedness and delivery location advice
        - Warning signs and urgent care needs
        - Sexual and reproductive health including contraception and STDs
        - Common pregnancy symptoms and how to manage them

  <FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
    <ENTRY>
      <Theme>STD Prevention</Theme>
      <Question>How to avoid sexually transmitted diseases?</Question>
      <Answer>
        To avoid sexually transmitted diseases, always use condoms correctly during sex and avoid having multiple sexual partners. Regular screening and testing are important, even if you have no symptoms, as some STDs can be silent. Openly discuss sexual health with your partner and seek medical advice if needed. These steps greatly reduce your risk of getting or spreading STDs.
      </Answer>
    </ENTRY>

    <ENTRY>
      <Theme>Number of Antenatal Care Visits</Theme>
      <Question>How many antenatal care visits do I need?</Question>
      <Answer>
        You need a minimum of 4 antenatal care visits during pregnancy, as recommended by WHO. However, ideally, 8 or more visits are advised for the best care and to detect any problems early. These checkups help monitor your health and your baby’s growth, manage any risks, and provide important advice for a safe delivery. Try to attend all scheduled visits and bring your reports each time.
      </Answer>
    </ENTRY>
    
    <ENTRY>
      <Theme>Stretch Marks in Pregnancy</Theme>
      <Question>What are stretch marks, and how can I prevent or treat them during pregnancy?</Question>
      <Answer>
        Stretch marks are lines that appear on the abdomen, buttocks, and shoulders when the skin stretches quickly during pregnancy. They are very common and not harmful. You can help reduce your risk by applying oils or creams to keep the skin soft during the latter half of pregnancy, gaining weight gradually, and eating a healthy diet. Most stretch marks fade with time after delivery, but there is no proven way to prevent them completely.

    <ENTRY>
      <Theme>Menstrual Irregularity After Childbirth</Theme>
      <Question>My friends say painful periods become normal after childbirth is this true?</Question>
      <Answer>
        It is true that, for some women, painful periods (dysmenorrhea) may become less severe or even normal after childbirth, but this does not happen for everyone. Some women continue to have painful periods, especially if the pain is caused by conditions like endometriosis or fibroids. If you still have severe pain after childbirth, it is important to talk to your doctor for proper advice and care.
